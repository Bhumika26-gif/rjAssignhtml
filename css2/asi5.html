        <div><strong>The Shaniwar Wada was normally the seven-story capital building of the Peshwas of the
                Maratha
                Empire. It was supposed to be made entirely of stone. However, after the completion of the base floor or
                the
                first story, the people of Satara (the national capital) complained to the Chhatrapati Shahu I (Emperor)
                saying
                that a stone monument can be sanctioned and built only by the emperor himself and not the Peshwas.
                Following
                this, an official letter was written to the Peshwas stating that the remaining building had to be made
                of brick
                and not stone.By 1758, at least a thousand people lived in the fort. In 1773, Narayanrao, who was the
                fifth and
                ruling Peshwa then, was murdered by guards on orders of his uncle Raghunathrao and aunt Anandibai. A
                popular
                legend has it that Narayanrao's ghost still calls for help on full moon nights. Various people, working
                around
                the area, have allegedly reported the cries of "Kaka mala vachava" (Uncle, save me) by Narayanrao
                Peshwa
                after his death.</strong>

Historically, the Lal Mahal is famous for an encounter between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Shaista Khan, where Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj cut off the fingers of the latter while trying to escape from the window of the Lal Mahal. The original Lal Mahal was constructed with the idea of rejuvenating the recently demolished city of Pune. Lal Mahal This is a new building made of brick and mortar.

        <div><strong>Shrimant Dagadusheth Halwai and his wife Laxmibai was a trader and sweet maker settled in Pune. His original halwai shop still exists under the name "Dagdusheth Halwai Sweets" near Datta Mandir in Pune. Eventually he became a successful sweet seller and a rich businessman. In the later 1800s, they lost their only son in a plague epidemic. They were approached by a compassionate sage who advised them to build a Ganesha temple in Pune. Later, as they did not have any heir, Dagdusheth adopted his nephew Govindsheth (born 1865) who was 9 years old at the time of their death. Govindsheth was born in 1891 in Pune. He replaced the first Ganesh idol by a new one, with the first one still being present at Akra Maruti Chowk. A kind-hearted and generous man, he established one more Ganesh idol in wrestlers training center, which is called Jagoba Dada Talim. This talim was owned by Dagdusheth as he was also a former wrestling trainer. One of the chowk (area) in Pune is named Govind Halwai Chowk, after him. Along with his mother, Govindsheth handled all the programmes like Ganesh Utsav, Datta Jayanti and other festivities. </strong> </div>
