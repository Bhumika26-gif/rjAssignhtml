        <h2 id="1">Classes and Objects</h2>
        <p>A class is a user defined< data-type used to bind and associated functions together. It allows the data(and
                functions) to be hidden, from external use. When defining a class, we are creating a new Abstract Data
                Type(ADT)that can be treated like any other built- in data type.</p>
                <p> The class body contains the declaration of variables and functions. These functions and variables
                    are collectively called as members of the class. They are usually grouped under two visibility
                    lables, namely, private and public.</p>
                <p>The members that have been declarred as private can be acessed only by the member functionns. such
                    data hiding using private declaration is the key feacture of object- oriented programming. The use
                    of the keyword private is optional. By default, member of a class are privaate. Public members can
                    be accessed from outside the class also. </p>
                <p> An object is an instance of a class. It can be uniquely identified by its name. It has physical
                    existence in the memory. Once a class has been declared, we can creae its objects in the same way as
                    varibles of any other type. Thus, an object is the varible of type class. Eaxmple:</p>
                <p>a class student is declared then we can create object of name as, Student s;</p>

        <h2 id="2">Characteristics of a Constructor function: </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Its name is same as name of its parent class.</li>
                    <li>It gets invoked implicitly when an object of its class is created.</li>
                    <li>It should be declarred in pubilc section of the class.</li>
                    <li> It does not have return-type,(not even void)</li>
                    <li>It can have default arguments</li>
                    <li> It can be overloaded. </li>
                    <li>It can not be Inherited. </li>
                    <li> It can not be a virtual function.</li>
                    <li>It can not contain argument of the same class to which it belongs.</li>
                </ol>
                <a href="#top">(Top)</a>

        <h2 id="3">Characteristics of a Friend Function </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li> Unlike member function, a friend function is not invoked using an object name
                        and the dot operator. It is invoked like a normal function. </li>
                    <li>It can not aceess memberr names directly. It needs to use dot operator and object name to access
                        members of that object. (e.g. s.rollno) </li>
                    <li>It can not use this keyword.</li>
                    <li>It may be declared in any ( private or public) part of the class.</li>
                    <li>A friend function has at least one argument which is of the type of the class(of which it is a
                        friend).</li>
                    <li>A class can be friend of many classes.</li>
                    <li>Member funtion of one class may be friend function of another class. </li>
                    <li>Even a class can be friend of another class. In such case, all member functions of the friend
                        class can access private members of the class.</li>
                    <li>It is not in the score of the class to which it has been declared as friend.</li>
                    <li>A friend function is not inherited.</li>
                </ol>
                <a href="#top">(Top)</a>

        <h2 id="4">Access Modifiers </h2>
                <p>There are three types of access modifiers in C++.</p>
                <li>Public: A member declared with public access modifier is accessible outside the class.</li>
                <li>Private: A member declared with private access modifier is not accessible outside the class except
                    its friend functins. </li>
                <li>Procted: A member declared with protected access modifier is not accessible outside the class its
                    friend functions and derived classes.</li>
                

                <p>Following table summerizes score of members with different access modifiers.</p>
                <table align="center" border="2">
