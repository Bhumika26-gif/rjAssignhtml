    <P>The first captain from India to win an ICC tournament and the greatest all rounder that India has ever seen. <strong>Kapil Dev</strong> was someone who changed the face of cricket in India. He played 131 Test Matches and he made 5248 runs with 8 Test hundreds and he took 434 Wickets which was a record at the time. He also played 225 ODIs and he made more than 3700 runs and took 253 wickets. In total he made over 9000 runs and took over 680 wickets. Nobody else has stats like the great man.</P>
