    <p>At number 5 is the original little master who was the first player in international cricket to cross the landmark of 10,000 runs which was considered unattainable at the time. He also made 34 Test hundreds which was also a record at the time . Sachin Tendulkar looked at him and got inspired to pick up a cricket bat. <strong>Sunil Gavaskar</strong>played without a helmet and still he made 774 runs in his debut series and in 125 Test Matches that he played in he made 10,122 runs.
