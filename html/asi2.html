    <p>The Savitribai Phule Pune University (formerly known as University of Poona) was established on 10th February 1949 under the Poona University Act, passed by the Bombay Legislature in 1948. In the same year, Dr. M. R. Jayakar assumed office as the first vice chancellor of the University.</p>
    <p>Shri B.G.Kher, Chief Minister and Education Minister, Govt. of Bombay, took a keen interest in setting apart a beautiful campus for the University. As a result of his efforts, a campus extending over 411 acres was allocated to the University in early 1949, on lease of 999 years without any premium and payment of nominal lease rent of â‚¹ One per annum. Payment of certain taxes such as N.A. Tax etc have also been waived.</p>

Out of these, two districts - Dhule and Jalgaon are attached to the North Maharashtra University established in August 1990.</p>
